# FYS-STK4155 - Project 3 - Solving PDEs using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Repository for Project 3 in FYS-STK4155 - Solving PDEs using Physics Informed Neural Networks<br /><br />
Here you'll find the programs, project report, and some additional results produced for the second project in the subject FYS-STK4155 at UiO.<br /><br />
The folder structure is:
- **01-main**: <br />Folder for the notebooks, programs, class-files and other support files used in the project.
- **02-doc**: <br /> The written report and .tex-files used to generate the report. The report abstract, introduction and some conclusions are given below.
- **03-results**: <br />A selection of figures and results generated during the project.
- **09-archive**: <br />Preliminary files not used in the final version of the project
<br /><br />

## Running the project programs
The project programs can be found in the **01-main** folder. They are organized in different Jupyter notebooks, and can be run given that the user downloads all files in **01-main**, and keeps them in a shared directory. <br />

The notebooks imports the classes and methods from three separate files. The main classes are..., which depend on ... and ...

The notebook also depends on a number of different python packages, such as _autograd_, _tensorflow_, _seaborn_, _matplotlib_ and _numpy_, so these are required to run the notebook.
