# project-3-fys-stk4155
## Topics
- Buckely-leverett equations - replicating shock-front - solving PDE or reproducing results from dataset (https://perminc.com/resources/fundamentals-of-fluid-flow-in-porous-media/chapter-4-immiscible-displacement/buckley-leverett-theory/)
- 2D - diffusion

## Constraints for regression/PINN
 - Need to be able to have an "analytical" solution for comparison
 - Need to have additional method of solving the equations, FD or FEM from MAT-MEK4270. Examples equations and solver from here might be a way to go
 - Well-posed PDE with a unique solution
